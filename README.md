# SONAR-WITH-ARDUINO
Creating a SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) project with Arduino to measure distances, detect objects, and display the detection on a PC screen:

# scripts:
- You will find both the Arduino code and the Processing code files
 - Arduino code : do not forget to change the pins
 - Processing code : do not forget to change the communication port

# beginner?
Follow the pdf to see an explanation of the code, library, modules, etc.

# Introduction:
Sound Navigation and Ranging. It is a technique involving the use of propagation of sound for navigation, and it can be used for distant object detection and interaction with other objects.
Some may commonly refer to this project as a ‘Radar’, it is important to note that radar stands for Radio Detection and Ranging, uses radio frequency (RF) waves.
# Resources:
In this project, you will need the Arduino IDE and the Processing Development Environment.
- Download Arduino: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
- Download Processing: https://processing.org/download
- You can check the simulation of this project on Tinkercad: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/b7tNtF2Yhzf?sharecode=OXqOpS_5RJ6fwrNVpYZPAhQctfYCMyYtJTnrGhP1gCI
# Components:
- Arduino
- Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
- Servo motor
- A breadboard or PCB and some jumper wires
